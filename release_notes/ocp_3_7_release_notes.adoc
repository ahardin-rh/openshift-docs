[[ocp-36-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[[ocp-37-container-orchestration]]
=== Container Orchestration

[[ocp-37kubernestes-upstream]]
==== Kubernetes Upstream

Many core features Google announced in June for Kubernetes 1.7 were the result
of OpenShift engineering. Red Hat continues to influence the product in the
areas of storage, networking, resource management, authentication and
authorization, multi-tenancy, security, service deployments, templating, and
controller functionality.

[[ocp-37-crio]]
==== CRI-O (Technology Preview)

CRI-O v1.0 (currently in xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview]) is a
lightweight, native Kubernetes container runtime interface. By design, it
provides only the runtime capabilities needed by the kublet. CRI-O is designed
to be part of Kubernetes and evolve in lock-step with the platform.

CRI-O brings:

* A minimal and secure architecture.
* Excellent scale and performance.
* The ability to run any Open Container Initiative (OCI) or docker image.
* Familiar operational tooling and commands.

[[ocp-37-cluster-wide-tolerations-per-namespace-tolerations]]
==== Cluster-wide Tolerations and Per-namespace Tolerations to Control Pod Placement

In a multi-tenant environment, you want to leverage administration controllers
to help define rules that can help govern a cluster, should a tenant not set a
toleration for placement.

The following is offered to administrators where the namespace setting will
override the cluster setting:

* Cluster-wide and per-namespace default toleration for pods.
* Cluster-wide and per-namespace white-listing of toleration for pods.

.Cluster-wide Off Example

[[ocp-37-security]]
=== Security

[[ocp-37-documented-private-public-key-configurations-and-crypto-levels]]
==== Documented Private and Public Key Configurations and Crypto Levels

{product-title} is a secured by default implementation of Kubernetes.

{product-title} leverages Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites, JSON Web
Algorithms (JWA) crypto algorithms, and offers external libraries such as The
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) and libgpgme.

xref:../architecture/index.adoc#architecture-index[Private and public key
configurations and Crypto levels] are now documented for {product-title}.

[[ocp-37-node-authorizer-node-restriction-admission-plug-in]]
==== Node Authorizer and Node Restriction Admission Plug-in

Pods can no longer try to gain information from secrets, configuration maps, PV,
PVC, or API objects from other nodes.

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/[Node authorizer]
governs what APIs a kublet can perform. Spanning read-, write-, and auth-related
operations. In order for the admission controller to know the identity of the
node to enforce the rules, nodes are provisioned with credentials that identify
them with the user name `system:node:<nodename>` and group `system:nodes`.

These enforcements are in place by default on all new installations of
{product-title} 3.7.  For upgrades from {product-title} 3.6, they are not in
place due to the `system:nodes` RBAC being granted from OCP 3.6. To turn the
enforcements on, run:

----
# oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:node system:nodes
----

[[ocp-37-advanced-auditing]]
==== Advanced Auditing (Technology Preview)

With Advanced Auditing (currently in xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology
Preview]), administrators are now exposed to more information from the API call
within the audit trail. This provides a deeper traceability of what is occurring
across the cluster.  We also capture all login events at the default logging
level and modifications to role binds and SCC.

{product-title} now has an audit `policyFile` or `policyConfiguration` where
administrators can filter in on what they want to capture.

See
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-advanced-audit[Advanced
Audit] for more information.

[[ocp-37-complete-upstreaming-of-rbac-then-downstreaming]]
==== Complete Upstreaming of RBAC, Then Downstreaming it Back into OpenShift

The rolebinding and RBAC experience is now the same across all Kubernetes
distributions.

Administrators do not have to do anything for this migration to occur. The
upgrade process to {product-title} 3.7 offers a seamless experience. Now, the
user experience is consistent with upstream.

A role can be defined within a namespace with a `Role`, or cluster-wide with a
`ClusterRole`.

A `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` binds a role to subjects. Subjects can
be groups, users, or service accounts. A role binding grants the permissions
defined in a role.

[[ocp-37-flexvolume-support-for-non-stotage-use-cases]]
==== Official FlexVolune Support for Non-storage Use Cases

There is now a supported interface to allow you to bind and mount in content
from a running pod. FlexVolume is a script interface that runs on the kublet and
offers five main functions to help you mount in content such as device drivers,
secrets, and certificates as bind mounts to the container from the host:

* `init` - Initialize the volume driver.
* `attach` - Attach the volume to the host.
* `mount` - Mount the volume on the host. This is the part that makes the volume available
to the host to mount it in *_/var/lib/kubelet_*.
* `unmount` - Unmount the volume.
* `detach` - Detach the volume from the host.

[[ocp-37-longer-lived-api-tokens-to-oauth-clients]]
==== Issue Longer-lived API Tokens to OAuth Clients

Administrators now have the ability to set different token timeouts for the
different ways users connect to {product-title} (for example, via the `oc` command
line, from a GitHub authentication, or from the web console).

Administrators can edit `oauthclients` and set the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to
a time value in seconds that meets their needs.

There are three possible OAuth client types:

. `openshift-web-console` -  The client used to request tokens for the OpenShift web console.

. `openshift-browser-client` - The client used to request tokens at
*_/oauth/token/request_* with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins,
such as using Auth from GitHub, Google Authenticator, and so on.

. `openshift-challenging-client` - The client used to request tokens with a user-agent that can
   handle WWW-Authenticate challenges, such as the `oc` command line.

- When `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` is set to `0`, tokens do not expire.
- When left blank, {product-title} uses the definition in `master-config`.
- Edit the client of interest via:
+
----
# oc edit oauthclients openshift-browser-client
----

- Set `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to `600`.
- Check the setting via:
+
----
# oc get oauthaccesstoken
----

See
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/other_api_objects.adoc#accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds[Other
API Objects] for more information.

[[ocp-37-storage]]
=== Storage

[[ocp-37-local-persistent-volumes]]
==== Local Storage Persistent Volumes (Technology Preview)

Local storage persistent volumes is currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview].

Local persistent volumes (PVs) now offer the ability to allow tenants to request
storage that is local to a node through the regular persistent volume claim
(PVC) process without needing to know the node.  Local storage is commonly used
in data store applications.

The administrator needs to create the local storage on the nodes, mount them
under directories, and then manually create the persistent volume (PV).
Alternatively, they can use an external provisioner and feed it the node
configuration via `configMaps`.

Example persistent volume named `example-local-pv` that some tenant can now claim:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-local-pv
  annotations:
    "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-affinity": '{
      "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
        "nodeSelectorTerms": [
          { "matchExpressions": [
            { "key": "kubernetes.io/hostname",
              "operator": "In",
              "values": ["my-node"]
            }
          ]}
         ]}
        }'

See
xref:../install_config/configuring_local.adoc#install-config-configuring-local[Configuring
for Local Volume] and
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-local[Persistent
Storage Using Local Volume] for more information.

[[ocp-37-tenant-driven-storage-snapshotting]]
==== Tenant-driven Storage Snapshotting (Technology Preview)

Tenant-driven storage snapshotting is currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview].

Tenants now have the ability to leverage the underlying storage technology
backing the persistent volume (PV) assigned to them to make a snapshot of their
application data. Tenants can also now restore a given snapshot from the past to
their current application.

An external provisioner is used to access the EBS, GCE pDisk, HostPath, and
Cinder snapshotting API. This Technology Preview feature has tested EBS and
HostPath. The tenant must stop the pods and start them manually.

. The administrator runs an external provisioner for the cluster. These are images
from the Red hat Container Catalog.

. The tenant made a PVC and owns a PV from one of the supported storage
solutions.The administrator must create a new `StorageClass` in the cluster with:
+
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: snapshot-promoter
provisioner: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/snapshot-promoter
----

. The tenant can create a snapshot of a PVC named `gce-pvc` and the resulting
snapshot will be called `snapshot-demo`.
+
----
$ oc create -f snapshot.yaml

apiVersion: volume-snapshot-data.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot-demo
  namespace: myns
spec:
  persistentVolumeClaimName: gce-pvc
----

. Now, they can restore their pod to that snapshot.
+
----
$ oc create -f restore.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: snapshot-pv-provisioning-demo
  annotations:
    snapshot.alpha.kubernetes.io/snapshot: snapshot-demo
spec:
  storageClassName: snapshot-promoter
----

[[ocp-37-storage-classes-get-zones]]
==== Storage Classes Get Zones

Public clouds are particular about not allowing storage to cross zones or
regions, so tenants need an ability at times to specify a particular zone.

In {product-title} 3.7, administrators can now leverage a zone's definition
within the `StorageClass`:

----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/<provisioner>
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  zones: zone1,zone2
----

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[Dynamic
Provisioning and Creating Storage Classes] for more information.

[[ocp-37-increased-volume-density]]
==== Increased Persistent Volume Density Support by CNS

Container-native storage (CNS) on {product-title} 3.7 now supports much higher
persistent volume density (three times more) to support a large number of
applications at scale. This is due to the introduction of brick-multiplexing
support in GlusterFS.

Over 1,000 volumes in a 3-node cluster with 32 GB per node available to
GlusterFS has been successfully tested. Also, 300 Block PVs are supported now on
3-node CNS .

[[ocp-37-cns-multi-protocol-support]]
==== CNS Multi-protocol (File, Block, and S3) Support for OpenShift

Container-native storage (CNS) is now extended support iSCSI and S3 back end for
{product-title}. Heketi is enhanced to support persistent volume (PV) expansion,
volume option, and HA.

Block device-based RWO implementation is added to CNS to improve the performance
of ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, and so on. With {product-title} 3.7, Elastic and
Cassandra are fully supported.

[[ocp-37-cns-full-support-infrastructure-services]]
==== CNS Full Support for Infrastructure Services

Container-native storage (CNS) now fully supports all {product-title}
infrastructure services: registry, logging, and metrics.

{product-title} logging (with Elasticsearch) and {product-title} metrics (with
Cassandra) are fully supported on persistent volumes backed by CNS/CRS iSCSI
block storage.

The {product-title} registry is hosted on CNS/CRS by RWX persistent volumes,
providing high availability and redundancy through Gluster architecture.

Logging and metrics were tested at scale with 1000+ pods.

[[cop-37-automated-cns-deployment-with-openshift-advanced-installation]]
==== Automated Container Native Storage Deployment with OpenShift Advanced Installation

{product-title} 3.7 now includes an integrated and simplified installation of
container-native storage (CNS) through the advanced installer. The advanced
installer is enhanced for automated and integrated support for deployment of CNS
including block provisioner, S3 provisioner, and files for correctly configured
out-of-the-box {product-title} and CNS. The CNS storage device details are added
to the installer’s inventory file. The installer manages configuration and
deployment of CNS, its dynamic provisioners, and other pertinent details.

[[ocp-37-scale]]
=== Scale

[[ocp-37-scale-cluster-limits]]
==== Cluster Limits

Updated guidance around
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] for {product-title} 3.7 is now available.

[[ocp-37-scale-tuned-profile-hierarchy]]
==== Updated Tuned Profile Hierarchy

The xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-tuned-profile[Tuned Profile Hierarchy]
is updated as of 3.7.

[[ocp-37-scale-cluster-loader]]
==== Cluster Loader

Guidance regarding use of
xref:../scaling_performance/using_cluster_loader.adoc#scaling-performance-using-cluster-loader[Cluster
Loader] is now available with the release of {product-title} 3.7. Cluster Loader
is a tool that deploys large numbers of various objects to a cluster, which
creates user-defined cluster objects. Build, configure, and run Cluster Loader
to measure performance metrics of your {product-title} deployment at various
cluster states.

[[ocp-37-scale-benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver]]
==== Guidance on Overlay Graph Driver with SELinux

In {product-title} 3.7, guidance about the
xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver[benefits
of using the Overlay Graph Driver with SELinux] is now available.

[[ocp-37-scale-providing-storage-to-an-etcd-node-using-pci-passthrough-with-openstack]]
==== Providing Storage to an etcd Node Using PCI Passthrough with OpenStack

Guidance on
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#providing-storage-to-an-etcd-node-using-pci-passthrough-with-openstack[Providing
Storage to an etcd Node Using PCI Passthrough with OpenStack] is now available.

[[ocp-37-networking]]
=== Networking

[[ocp-37-network-policy]]
==== Network Policy
Network Policy is now fully supported in {product-title} 3.7.

Network Policy is an optional plug-in specification of how selections of pods
are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. It
provides fine-grained network namespace isolation using labels and port
specifications.

After installing the Network Policy plug-in, an annotation that flips the
namespace from `allow all traffic` to `deny all traffic` must first be set on
the namespace. At that point, `NetworkPolicies` can be created that define what
traffic to allow. The annotation is as follows:

----
$ oc annotate namespace ${ns} 'net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={"ingress":{"isolation":"DefaultDeny"}}'
----

The allow-to-red policy specifies "all red pods in namespace `project-a` allow
traffic from any pods in any namespace." This does not apply to the red pod in
namespace `project-b` because `podSelector` only applies to the namespace in
which it was applied.

.Policy applied to project
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-to-red
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: red
  ingress:
  - {}
----

See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-manage-networking[Managing
Networking] for more information.

[[ocp-27-cluster-ip-range-more-flexible]]
==== Cluster IP Range Now More Flexible

Cluster IP ranges are now more flexible by allowing multiple subnets for hosts.
This provides the capability to allocate multiple, smaller IP address ranges for
the cluster. This makes it easier to migrate from one allocated IP range to
another.

There are multiple comma-delimited CIDRs in the configuration file. Each node is
allocated only a single subnet from within any of the available ranges. You can
not allocate different-sized host subnets, or use this to change the host subnet
size The `clusterNetworkCIDRs` can be different sizes, but must be equal to or
larger than the host subnet size It is not allowed to have some nodes use
subnets that are not part of the `clusterNetworkCIDRs`.

In regard to migration or edits, networks can be added to the list, CIDRs in the
list may be re-ordered, and a CIDR can be removed from the list when there are
no nodes that have an SDN allocation from that CIDR.

Example:

----
clusterNetworkCIDR: 10.1.0.0/24, 10.1.5.0/24, 10.2.1.0/24 …
----

[[ocp-37-routes-alloed-to-set-cookie-names-for-session-stickiness]]
==== Routes Allowed to Set Cookie Names for Session Stickiness

The HAProxy router can look for a cookie in a client request. Based on that
cookie name and value, always route requests that have that cookie to the same
pod instead of relying upon the client source IP, which can be obscured by an F5
doing load balancing.

A cookie with a unique name is used to handle session persistence.

. Set a per-route configuration to set the cookie name used for the session.
. Add an `env` to set a router-wide default.
. Ensure that the cookie is set and honored by the router to control access.

Example scenario:

. Set a default cookie name for the HAProxy router:
+
----
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_COOKIE_NAME=default-cookie
----

. Log in as a normal user and create the project/pod/svc/route:
+
----
$ oc login user1
$ oc new-project project1
$ oc create -f https://example.com/myhttpd.json
$ oc create -f https://example.com/service_unsecure.json
$ oc expose service service-unsecure
----

. Access the route:
+
----
$ curl $route -v
----
+
The HTTP response will contain the cookie name. For example:
+
----
Set-Cookie: default_cookie=[a-z0-9]+
----

. Modify the cookie name using route annotation:
+
----
$ oc annotate route service-unsecure router.openshift.io/cookie_name="route-cookie"
----

. Re-access the route:
+
----
$ curl $route -v
----
+
The HTTP response will contain the new cookie name:
+
----
Set-Cookie: route-cookie=[a-z0-9]+
----

See
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#route-specific-annotations[Route-specific
Annotations] for more information.

[[ocp-37-hsts-policy-support]]
==== HSTS Policy Support

xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#hsts[HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS)] ensures all communication between the server and client is encrypted and
that all sent and received responses are delivered to and received from the
authenticated server.

An HSTS policy is provided to the client via an HTTPS header (HSTS headers over
HTTP are ignored) using an `haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header` annotation
to the route. When the Strict-Transport-Security response in the header is
received by a client, it observes the policy until it is updated by another
response from the host, or it times-out (`max-age=0`).

Example using reencrypt route:

. Create the pod/svc/route:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://example.com/test.yaml
----

. Set the Strict-Transport-Security header:
+
----
$ oc annotate route serving-cert haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header="max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload"
----

. Access the route using `https`:
+
----
$ curl --head https://$route -k

   ...
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload
   ...
----

[[ocp-37-semi-automatic-namespace-wide-egress-ip]]
==== Semi-automatic Namespace-wide Egress IP

All outgoing external connections from a project will share a single
fixed-source IP address and will send all traffic via that IP so that external
firewalls can recognize the application associated with a packet.

See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-manage-networking[Managing
Networking] for more information.

[[ocp-37-master]]
=== Master

[[ocp-37-public-pull-url-provided-for-images]]
==== Public Pull URL Provided for Images

A public pull URL is provided for images versus being able to know the internal
in-cluster IP or DNS of the service.

A new API field for the image stream with the public URL of the image was added,
and a public URL is configured in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.  The web
console will understand this new field and generate the public pull
specifications automatically to users (so users can just copy and paste the pull
URL).

Example:

. Check the `internalRegistryHostname` setting in the *_master-config.yaml_* file:
+
----
  ...
  imagePolicyConfig:
    internalRegistryHostname: docker-registry.default.svc:5000
  ...
----

. Delete the `OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` variable in both:
+
----
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

. Start a build and check the push URL. It should push the new build image with
`internalRegistryHostname` to the `docker-registry`.

[[ocp-37-custom-resource-definitions]]
==== Custom Resource Definitions

A _resource_ is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of
API objects of a certain kind (for example, pod objects). A _custom resource
definition_ is a built-in API that enables the ability to plug in your own
custom, managed object and application as if it were native to Kubernetes.
Therefore, you can leverage Kubernetes cluster management, RBAC and
authentication services,  PI services, CLI, security, and so on, without having
to know Kubernetes internals or modifying Kubernetes itself in any way.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) deprecates Third Party Resources in Kubernetes
1.7.

How it works:

. Define a CRD class (your custom objects) and register the new resource type.
This defines how it fits into the hierarchy and how it will be referenced from
the CLI and API.

. Define a function to create a custom client, which is aware of the new resource
schema.

. Once completed, it can be accessed from the CLI. However, in order to build
controllers or custom functionality, you need API access to the objects, and so
you need to build a set of CRUD functions (library) to access the objects and the event-driven listener for controllers.

. Create a client that:
+
* Connects to the Kubernetes cluster.
* Creates the new CRD (if it does not exist).
* Creates a new custom client.
* Creates a new test object using the client library.
* Creates a controller that listens to events associated with new resources.

See
xref:../admin_guide/custom_resource_definitions.adoc#admin-guide-custom-resources[Extending
the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources] for more information.

Container-Native Storage for OpenShift Container Platform 3.6] guide describes
the prerequisites and provides step-by-step instructions to deploy
container-native storage (Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3) with {product-title}.

[[ocp-37-openshift-for-ops-test-drive]]
==== OpenShift for Ops Test Drive

The link:https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/openshift-storage-testdrive-20170718[OpenShift for Ops Test Drive] provides system administrators with a no-cost, hands-on lab experience to evaluate OpenShift in a fully functional cloud-based environment.
There is a self-paced, hands-on lab environment, in which students learn:

* How to install and configure OpenShift, including log and metrics aggregation and external authentication.
* How to install and configure CNS (Red Hat Gluster Storage) inside {product-title}.
* How to perform basic administrative and maintenance operations.
* Basic application life cycle with health and readiness monitoring.

[[ocp-37-installation]]
=== Installation

[[ocp-37-migrate-etcd-before-upgarde]]
==== Migrate etcd Before OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 Upgrade
Starting in {product-title} 3.7, the use of the etcd3 v3 data model is required.

{product-title} gains performance improvements with the v3 data model. In order
to upgrade the data model, an embedded etcd configuration option in no longer
allowed. Embedded is not co-located and mainly used in single-master
deployments. Migration scripts will convert the v3 data model and allow you to
move an embedded etcd to an external etcd either on the same host or a different
host than the masters. In addition, there is a new scale up ability for etcd
clusters.

See
xref:../install_config/upgrading/migrating_embedded_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating
Embedded etcd to External etcd] for more information.

[[ocp-37-modular-installer]]
==== Modular Installer to Allow Playbooks to Run Independently

The installer has been enhanced to allow administrators to install specific
components. By breaking up the roles and playbooks, there is better targeting of
ad hoc administration tasks.

[[new-install-experience-around-phases]]
==== New Installation Experience Around Phases
When you run the installer, {product-title} now reports back at the end what
phases you have gone through.

If the installation fails during a phase, you will be notified on the screen
along with the errors from the Ansible run. Once you resolve the issue, rather
than run the entire installation over again, you can pick up from the failed
phase. This results in an increased level of control during installations and
results in time savings.

[[ocp-37-increased-control-over-image-stream-templates]]
==== Increased Control Over Image Stream and Templates
With {product-title} 3.7, there is added control over whether or not your cluster
automatically upgrades all the content provided during cluster upgrades.

Edit the `openshift_install_examples` variable in the hosted file or set it as a variable in the installer.

----
RPM = /etc/origin/examples /etc/origin/hosted
Container = /usr/share/openshift/examples /usr/share/openshift/hosted

openshift_install_examples=false
----

Setting `openshift_install_examples` to `false` will cause the installer to not
upgrade the imagestream and templates. `True` is the default behavior.

[[ocp-37-install-config-cfme-from-ocp-installer]]
==== Installation and Configuration of CFME 4.6 from the OpenShift Installer

CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) 4.6 is now fully supported running on
{product-title} 3.7 as a set of containers. CFME is an available API endpoint on
all {product-title} clusters that choose to use it. More cluster administrators
are now able to leverage CFME and begin experiencing the insight and automations
available to them in {product-title}.

To install CFME 4.6:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -i <YOUR_INVENTORY>
playbooks/byo/openshift-management/config.yml
----

To configure CFME 4.6 to consume the {product-title} installation it is running on:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -i <YOUR_INVENTORY>
playbooks/byo/openshift-management/add_container_provider.yml
----

You can also automate the configuration of the provider to point to multiple OpenShift clusters:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -e container_providers_config=/tmp/cp.yml
playbooks/byo/openshift-management/add_many_container_providers.yml
----

[[ocp-37-diagnostics]]
=== Diagnostics

[[ocp-37-additional-health-checks]]
==== Additional Health Checks

More health checks are now available for administrators to run after
installations and upgrades. Administrators need the ability to run tests
periodically to help determine the health of the framework components within the
cluster. {product-title} 3.7 offers test functionality via Ansible playbooks
that can be run and output can be sent as file-based output.

----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/adhoc.yml
                curator
                diagnostics
                disk_availability
                docker_image_availability
                docker_storage
                elasticsearch
                etcd_imagedata_size
                etcd_traffic
                etcd_volume
                fluentd
                fluentd_config
                kibana
                logging
                logging_index_time
                memory_availability
                ovs_version
                package_availability
                package_update
                package_version

$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/adhoc.yml -e
openshift_checks=fluentd_config,logging_index_time,docker_storage
----

Alternatively, they are included in the health playbook:

----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/health.yml
----

To capture the output:

----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/health.yml -e
openshift_checks_output_dir=/tmp/checks
----

[[ocp-37-metrics-and-logging]]
=== Metrics and Logging

[[ocp-37-journald-system-logs]]
==== Jouranld for System Logs and JSON File for Container Logs

Docker log driver is set to `json-fiile` as the default for all nodes. Docker
`log-driver` can be set to `journal`, but there is no log rate throttling with
journal driver. So, there is always a risk for denial-of-service attacks from
rogue containers.

Fluentd will automatically determine which log driver (`journald` or
`json-file`) the container runtime is using. Fluentd will now always read logs
from journald and also *_/var/log/containers_* (if `log-driver` is set to
`json-file`). Fluentd will no longer read from *_/var/log/messages_*.

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-docker-events-and-api-calls-aggregated-to-efk-as-logs]]
==== Docker Events and API Calls Aggregated to EFK as Logs

Fluentd captures standard error and standard out from the running containers on
the node. With this change, fluentd collects all the errors and events coming
from the docker daemon running on the node and sends it to Elasticsearch (ES).

Enable this via the {product-title} installer:

----
openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_container_engine=true
----

The collected information is in operation indices of ES and only cluster
administrators have visual access. The event message includes action, pod name,
image name, and user time-stamp.

[[ocp-37-master-events-aggregated-to-efk-as-logs]]
==== Master Events are Aggregated to EFK as Logs

The *eventrouter* pod scrapes the events from kubernetes API and and outputs to
*STDOUT*. The *fluentd* plug-in transforms the log message and sends it to
Elasticsearch (ES).

Enable `openshift_logging_install_eventrouter` by setting it to `true`. It is
off by default. *Eventrouter* is deployed to the default namespace. Collected
information is in operation indices of ES and only cluster administrators have
visual access.

See the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/blob/master/docs/proposals/kube_events_design_doc.md[design
documentation] for more information.

==== Kibana Dashboards for Operations Are Now Shareable

This allows {product-title} administrators the ability to share saved Kibana
searches, visualizations, and dashboards.

When `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_kibana_index_mode` is set to `shared_ops`, one
`admin` user can create queries and visualizations for other `admin` users.
Other users can not see those same queries and visualizations.

When `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_kibana_index_mode` is set to `unique`,
users can only see saved queries and visualizations they created. This is the
default behavior.

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-removed-es-copy-method]]
==== Removed ES_Copy Method for Sending Logs to External ES

`ES_Copy` was replaced with the *secure_formard* plug-in for fluentd to send
logs from fluentd to external fluentd (that can then ingest into ES). `ES_COPY`
is removed from the installer and the documentation.

When `openshift_installer` is run for logging to upgrade to 3.7, the installer
now checks for `ES_COPY` in the inventory and fails the upgrade with:

----
msg: The ES_COPY feature is no longer supported. Please remove the variable from your inventory
----

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#fluentd-log-external-elasticsearch[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-expose-es-as-a-route]]
==== Expose Elasticsearch as a Route

By default, Elasticsearch (ES) deployed with OpenShift aggregated logging is not
accessible from outside the logging cluster. This enables a route for external
access to ES for those tools that want to access its data.

You now have direct access to ES using only your OpenShift token and have the
ability to provide the external ES and ES Ops hostnames when creating the server
certificate (similar to Kibana). Ansible tasks now simplify route deployment.

[[ocp-37-removed-metrics-and-logging-deployers]]
==== Removed Metrics and Logging Deployers

The metrics and logging deployers bare now replaced with `playbook2image` for
`oc cluster up` so that `openshift-ansible` is used to install logging and
metrics:

----
$ oc cluster up --logging --metrics
----

Check metrics and pod status:

----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-infra
$ oc get pod -n logging
----

[[ocp-37-prometheus]]
==== Prometheus (Technology Preview)

{product-title} operators deploy Prometheus (currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview] on a {product-title} cluster,
collect Kubernetes and infrastructure metrics, and get alerts. Operators can see
and query metrics and alerts on the Prometheus web dashboard, or bring their own
Grafana and hook it up to Prometheus.

See xref:../nstall_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus
on OpenShift] for more information.

[[ocp-37-integrated-approach-to-adding-hosa]]
==== Integrated Approach to Adding Hawkular OpenShift Agent (Techology Preview)

Hawkular OpenShift Agent (HOSA) remains in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview]. It is packaged and can now
be installed with the `openshift_metrics_install_hawkular_agent` option in the
installer by setting it to `true`.

See
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variable[Enabling
Cluster Metrics] for more information.

[[ocp-37-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

[[ocp-37-template-instantation-api]]
==== Template Instantiation API

Clients can now easily invoke a server API instead of relying on client logic.

* To set parameters, create a secret with values.
* Create a `TemplateInstance` containing the whole template you want to
instantiate, and a reference to the secret created above.
* Poll the `TemplateInstance` or watch the `TemplateInstance` until either the
`Ready` or `InstantiateFailure` condition types report status `True`.

----
$ curl -k \
    -X POST \
    -d @-  \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $Token" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://$ENDPOINT/apis/template.openshift.io/v1/templateinstances <<'EOF'
{
  "kind": "TemplateInstance",
  "apiVersion": "template.openshift.io/v1",
  ...
  EOF
----

[[ocp-37-dev-experience-metrics]]
==== Metrics

{product-title} now includes needed Prometheus monitoring and alerting. Expose
build step timings (time to pull images, fetch sources, run assemble, commit
images, push images). Expose failure reasons (for example, see that builds are
consistently failing due to failure to fetch source).

[[ocp-37-web-console]]
=== Web Console

[[ocp-37-openshift-ansible-broker]]
==== OpenShift Ansible Broker

In {product-title} 3.7, Open Service Broker API is implemented, enabling users
to leverage Ansible for provisioning and managing services from the Service
Catalog. This is a standardized approach for delivering simple to complex
multi-container OpenShift services via Ansible. It works in conjunction with
Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB) for lightweight application definition. APBs can
be used to deliver and orchestrate on-platform services, but could also be used
to provision and orchestrate off-platform services (from cloud providers, IaaS,
and so on).

OpenShift Ansible Broker supports production workloads and multiple service
plans. There is now secure connectivity between Service Catalog and Service
Broker.

You can interact with the Service Catalog to provision and manage services while
the details of the broker remain largely hidden.

[[ocp-37-ansible-playbook-bundles]]
==== Ansible Playbook Bundles

Ansible Playbook Bundles (APBs) are short-lived, lightweight container image
consisting of:

* a simple directory structure with named action playbooks.
* metadata (required and optional parameters, as well asdependencies).
* an Ansible runtime environment.

Developer tooling is included, providing a guided approach to APB creation.
There is also support for the *_test_* playbook, allowing for functional testing
of the service.) Two new APBs are introduced for MariaDB (SCL) and  MySQL DB
(SCL).

When a user provisions an application from the Service Catalog, the Ansible
Service Broker will download the associated APB image from the registry and run
it.

Developing APBs can be done in one of two ways: Creating the APB container image
manually using standardized container creation tooling, or with APB tooling that
Red Hat will deliver, which provides a guided approach to creation.

[[ocp-37-iopenshift-template-broker]]
==== OpenShift Template Broker

The OpenShift Template Broker exposes templates through a Open Service Broker
API to the Service Catalog.

The Template Broker matches the lifecycles of `provision`, `deprovision`,
`bind`, and `unbind` with existing templates. No changes are required to
templates, unless you expose `bind`. Your application will get injected with
configuration details.

[[ocp-37-initial-experience]]
==== Initial Experience

{product-title} 3.7 provides a better initial user experience with the Service
Catalog. This includes:

* A task-focused interface
* Key call-outs
* Unified search
* Streamlined navigation

The new user interface is designed to really streamline the getting started
process, in addition to incorporating the new Service Catalog items. It shows
the existing content (for example, builder images and templates) as well as
catalog items (if the catalog is enabled).

[NOTE]
====
The new user experience can be enabled as a Technology Preview feature without
the Service Catalog to be active. A cluster with this user interface (UI)
would still be supported. Running the catalog UI without the Service Catalog
enabled will work, but access to templates without the catalog will require a
few extra steps.
====

[[ocp-37-search-catalog]]
==== Search Catalog

{product-title} 3.7 provides a simple way to quickly get what you want The new
Search Catalog user interface is designed to make it much easier to find items
in a number of ways, making it even faster to find the items you are wanting to
deploy.

image::3.7-search-filter-catalog.gif[search catalog]

[[ocp-37-add-from-catalog]]
==== Add from Catalog

Provision a service from the catalog. Select the desired service and follow
prompts for the desired project and configuration details.

image::3.7-add-to-project-wizard-animated.gif[add to project]

[[ocp-37-connect-a-service]]
==== Connect a Service
Once a service is deployed, get coordinates to connect the application to it.

The broker returns a secret, which is stored in the project for use. You are
guided through a process to update the deployment to inject a secret.

image::3.7-bind-mongodb-nodejs-at-creation.gif[connect a service]

[[ocp-37-include-templates-from-oter-projects]]
==== Include Templates from Other Projects

Since templates are now served through a broker, there is now a way for you to
deploy templates from other projects.

Upload the template, then select the template from a project.

image::3.7-add-to-project-options.png[Add to Project Options]

[[ocp-37-notifications]]
==== Notifications
Key notifications are now under a single UI element, the notification drawer.

The bell icon is decorated when new notifications exist. You can mark all read,
clear all, view all, or dismiss individual ones. Key notifications are
represented with the level of information, warning, or error.

image::3.7-notification-drawer.png[Notification drawer]

[[ocp-37-improved-quota-warnings]]
==== Improved Quota Warnings
Quota notifications are now put in the notification drawer and are less intrusive.

image::37-quota-warning.png[quota warning]

There are now separate notifications for each quota type instead of one generic
warning. When at quota and not over quota, this is displayed as an informative
message. Usage and maximum is displayed in the message. You can mark *Don't Show
Me Again* per quota type. Administrators can create custom messages to the quota
warning.

[[ocp-47-environment-variable-editor-added-to-stateful-sets-page]]
==== Environment Variable Editor Added to the Stateful Sets Page

An environment variable editor is now added to the *Stateful Sets* page.

image::37-statefulset-page-envar-editor.png[Stateful Sets Page]

[[ocp-37-support-for-envfrom]]
==== Support for the EnvFrom Construct

Anything with a pod template now supports the `EnvFrom` construct that lets you
break down an entire configuration map or secret into environment variables without
explicitly setting `env name` to  `key mappings`.

[[ocp-36-notable-technical-changes]]
== Notable Technical Changes

{product-title} 3.7 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[[ocpapi-connectivity-variables-now-deprecated]]
=== API Connectivity Variables OPENSHIFT_MASTER and KUBERNETES_MASTER Are Now Deprecated

{product-title} deployments using a
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy[custom
strategy] or
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#lifecycle-hooks[hooks]
are provided with a container environment, which includes two variables for API
connectivity:

* `OPENSHIFT_MASTER`: A URL to the OpenShift API .
* `KUBERNETES_MASTER`: A URL to the Kubernetes API exposed by OpenShift.

These variables are now deprecated, as they refer to internal endpoints rather
than the published OpenShift API service endpoints. To connect to the OpenShift
API in these contexts, use
xref:../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[service DNS]
or the automatically exposed `KUBERENTES`
xref:../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#automatically-added-environment-variables[service
environment variables].

The `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` and `KUBERNETES_MASTER` environment variables are removed
from deployment container environments as of {product-title} 3.7.

[discrete]
[[openshift-hosted-ansible-variables-now-deprecated]]
=== openshift_hosted_{logging,metrics}_* Ansible Variables for the Installer Are Now Deprecated

The `openshift_hosted_{logging,metrics}_*` Ansible variables used by the
installer have been deprecated. The
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[installation
documentation] has been updated to use the newer variable names. The deprecated
variable names are planned for removal in the next minor release of OpenShift
Container Platform.

[discrete]
[[removed-generatedeploymentconfig-api-endpoint]]
=== Removed generatedeploymentconfig API Endpoint

The `generatedeploymentconfig` API endpoint is now removed

[discrete]
[[deprecating-some-plicy-related-apis]]
=== Deprecated Policy Related APIs and Commands

A large number of policy related APIs and commands are now deprecated. In
{product-title} 3.7, the policy objects are completely removed and native RBAC
is used instead. Any command trying to directly manipulate a policy object will
fail. Roles and rolebindings endpoints are still available, and they proxy the
operation to create native RBAC objects instead. The following commands do not
work against a 3.7 server:

----
$ oadm overwrite-policy
$ oadm migrate authorization
$ oc create policybinding
----

[NOTE]
====
A 3.7 client will display an error message when trying these command against a
3.7 server, but will still work against a previous server version, and old
client will just fail hard against a 3.7 server.
====

[discrete]
[[RHELAH-version-7-4-2-1-required-containerized-installations]]
=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host Version 7.4.2.1 or Newer Required for Containerized Installations

In {product-title} 3.7, containerized installations require Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Atomic Host version 7.4.2.1 or newer.

[discrete]
[[installer-labeling-clusters-for-aws]]
=== Labeling Clusters for Amazon Web Services

Starting with 3.7 versions of the installer, if you configured AWS provider
credentials, you must also ensure that all instances are labeled. Then, set the
`openshift_clusterid` variable to the cluster ID. See
xref:../admin_guide/aws_cluster_labeling.adoc#admin-guide-aws-cluster-labeling[Labeling
Clusters for Amazon Web Services (AWS)] for more information.

[discrete]
[[stricter-sccs]]
=== Stricter Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

With the release of {product-title} 3.7, there are now some stricter security
context constraints (SCCs). The following capabilities are now removed:

- *nonroot* drops `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`.
- *hostaccess* drops `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`.
- *hostmount-anyuid* drops `MKNOD`.

It is possible that the pods that previously were admitted by these SCCs, and
were using such capabilities, will fail after upgrade. In these rare cases, the
cluster administrator should create a custom SCC for such pods.

[discrete]
[[updated-installer-support-for-cfme]]
=== Updated Installer Support for CFME 4.6

There is now updated installer support for CloudForms Management Engine (CFME)
4.6 on {product-title} 3.7.

[discrete]
[[updated-installer-support-for-cfme]]
=== Node Authorizer and Admission Plug-in for Managing Node Permissions

In {product-title} 3.7, the node authorizer and admission plug-in are used to
manage and limit a node's permissions. Therefore, nodes should be removed from
the group that previously granted them broad permissions across the cluster:

----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:node system:nodes
----

In {product-title} 3.8, this step should be performed automatically via Ansible
as a post-upgrade step.

[discrete]
[[kube-service-catalog-global]]
=== The kube-service-catalog Namespace Is Global

The `kube-service-catalog` namespace is now made global by Ansible. Therefore,
if you want multicast to work in vnid 0, you must set the
`netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled=true` annotation on both
namespaces (`default` and `kube-service-catalog`).

[[ocp-37-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

* The installer can not deploy system container-based installations when the
specified registry requires authentication credentials in order to pull the
required system container images. The fix for this depends on an update to the
`atomic` command, which will be updated after {product-title} 3.7 GA.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1505744[*BZ#1505744*])

* A {product-title} 3.7 master will return an unstructured response instead of
structured JSON when an action is forbidden. This is a known issue and will be
fixed in {product-title} 3.8.

* The volume snapshot Technology Preview feature may not be available to
non-administrator users by default due to API RBAC settings. When the volume
snapshot controller and provisioner are installed and run, the cluster
administrator needs to configure the API access to the VolumeSnapshot objects by
creating roles and cluster roles, then assigning them to the desired users or
user groups.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502945[*BZ#1502945*])

[[ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates]]
== Asynchronous Errata Updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} 3.7 are released
as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} 3.7
