= Tested applications for GlusterFS storage

Red Hat performed extensive testing with these (no)SQL databases:

-  Postgresql SQL v9.6
-  MongoDB noSQL v3.2

The storage for these databases originated from a converged mode storage cluster.

For Postgresql SQL benchmarking
link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/pgbench.html[pgbench] was used
for database benchmarking. For MongoDB noSQL benchmarking YCSB
link:https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/mongodb[Yahoo! Cloud
Serving Benchmark] was used for benchmarking and
link:https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/workloads[workloada,workloadb,workloadf]
were tested.

*Test results*

For Postgresql SQL databases, GlusterFS and gluster-block showed approximately
the same performance results. For MongoDB noSQL databases, gluster-block
performed better. Therefore, use gluster-block based storage for MongoDB noSQL
databases.
