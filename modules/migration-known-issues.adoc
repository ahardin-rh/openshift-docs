= Known issues

The following issues will be addressed in a future release:

* When an application is migrated, the CAM preserves the following namespace annotations:

** `openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups`
** `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`
+
These annotations preserve the UID range, ensuring that the containers retain their file system permissions on the target cluster. There is a risk that the migrated UIDs could duplicate UIDs within an existing or future namespace on the target cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748440[*BZ1748440*])

* Restic times out when staging a migration of more than 50 projects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1749831[BZ1749831])
* Currently, when adding an S3 endpoint to the CAM, `https://` is supported only
for AWS. For other S3 providers, use `http://`.
* The `EnsureCloudSecretPropagated` phase is skipped with a logged warning on
{product-title} 3.9 with a known docker bug. See
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3734981[docker exec or oc rsh fails
with oci error: Connection reset by peer] for more information.

* Cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by the application migration tool,
including resources such as Cluster Role Bindings and Security Context
Constraints. If applications you are migrating depend on these kind of
cluster-scoped resources on the source cluster, manually ensure they are
recreated on the destination cluster. Coverage will be expanded in a future
release to handle these resources.
