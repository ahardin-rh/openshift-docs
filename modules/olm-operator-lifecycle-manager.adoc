= Understanding the Operator Lifecycle Manager

In {product-title} {product-version}, the _Operator Lifecycle Manager_ (OLM) helps users
install, update, and manage the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated
services running across their clusters. It is part of the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework],
an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications
(Operators) in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

.Operator Lifecycle Manager workflow

The OLM runs by default in {product-title} {product-version}, which aids cluster
administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators
running on their cluster. The {product-title} web console provides management
screens for cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant
specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the
cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring
instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be
subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.

[id="olm-csv-{context}"]
== ClusterServiceVersions (CSVs)

A _ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) is a YAML manifest created from Operator
metadata that assists the OLM in running the Operator in a cluster. It is the
metadata that accompanies an Operator container image, used to populate user
interfaces with information like its logo, description, and version. It is also
a source of technical information needed to run the Operator, like the RBAC
rules it requires and which Custom Resources (CRs) it manages or depends on.

A CSV is composed of:

Metadata::
* Application metadata:
** Name, description, version, links, labels, icon, etc.

Install strategy::
* Type: Deployment
** Set of service accounts and required permissions
** Set of Deployments.

CRDs::
* Type
* Owned: Managed by this service
* Required: Must exist in the cluster for this service to run
* Resources: A list of resources that the Operator interacts with
* Descriptors: Annotate CRD spec and status fields to provide semantic information

[id="olm-architecture-{context}"]
== Operator Lifecycle Manager Architecture

The Operator Lifecycle Manager is composed of two Operators: the OLM Operator
and the Catalog Operator.

Each of these Operators are responsible for managing the CRDs that are the basis
for the OLM framework:

.CRDs managed by OLM and Catalog Operators
[cols="2a,1a,1a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Resource |Short name |Owner |Description

|ClusterServiceVersion
|`csv`
|OLM
|Application metadata: name, version, icon, required resources, installation,
etc.

|InstallPlan
|`ip`
|Catalog
|Calculated list of resources to be created in order to automatically install or
upgrade a CSV.

|CatalogSource
|`catsrc`
|Catalog
|A repository of CSVs, CRDs, and packages that define an application.

|Subscription
|`sub`
|Catalog
|Used to keep CSVs up to date by tracking a channel in a package.

|OperatorGroup
|`og`
|OLM
|Used to group multiple namespaces and prepare them for use by an Operator.
|===

Each of these Operators are also responsible for creating resources:

[id="olm-architecture-olm-operator-{context}"]
== OLM Operator

The OLM Operator is responsible for deploying applications defined by CSV
resources after the required resources specified in the CSV are present in the
cluster.

The OLM Operator is not concerned with the creation of the required resources;
users can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI, or users can
choose to create these resources using the Catalog Operator. This separation of
concern enables users incremental buy-in in terms of how much of the OLM
framework they choose to leverage for their application.

While the OLM Operator is often configured to watch all namespaces, it can also
be operated alongside other OLM Operators so long as they all manage separate
namespaces.

.OLM Operator workflow
* Watches for ClusterServiceVersion (CSVs) in a namespace and checks that
requirements are met. If so, runs the install strategy for the CSV.
+
NOTE: A CSV must be an active member of an OperatorGroup in order for the
install strategy to be run.

[id="olm-architecture-catalog-operator-{context}"]
== Catalog Operator

The Catalog Operator is responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the
required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching
CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them
(optionally automatically) to the latest available versions.

A user that wishes to track a package in a channel creates a Subscription
resource configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource from
which to pull updates. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan is
written into the namespace on behalf of the user.

Users can also create an InstallPlan resource directly, containing the names of
the desired CSV and an approval strategy, and the Catalog Operator creates an
execution plan for the creation of all of the required resources. After it is
approved, the Catalog Operator creates all of the resources in an InstallPlan;
this then independently satisfies the OLM Operator, which proceeds to install
the CSVs.

.Catalog Operator workflow
* Has a cache of CRDs and CSVs, indexed by name.
* Watches for unresolved InstallPlans created by a user:
** Finds the CSV matching the name requested and adds it as a resolved resource.
** For each managed or required CRD, adds it as a resolved resource.
** For each required CRD, finds the CSV that manages it.
* Watches for resolved InstallPlans and creates all of the discovered resources for it (if approved by a user or automatically).
* Watches for CatalogSources and Subscriptions and creates InstallPlans based on them.

[id="olm-architecture-catalog-registry-{context}"]
== Catalog Registry

The Catalog Registry stores CSVs and CRDs for creation in a cluster and stores
metadata about packages and channels.

A _package manifest_ is an entry in the Catalog Registry that associates a
package identity with sets of CSVs. Within a package, channels point to a
particular CSV. Because CSVs explicitly reference the CSV that they replace, a
package manifest provides the Catalog Operator all of the information that is
required to update a CSV to the latest version in a channel (stepping through
each intermediate version).

[id="olm-architecture-operatorgroups-{context}"]
== OperatorGroups

An _OperatorGroup_ is an OLM resource that provides multitenant configuration to
OLM-installed Operators. An OperatorGroup selects a set of target namespaces in
which to generate required RBAC access for its member Operators. The set of
target namespaces is provided by a comma-delimited string stored in the CSV's
`olm.targetNamespaces` annotation. This annotation is applied to member
Operator's CSV instances and is projected into their deployments.

[discrete]
=== OperatorGroup membership

An Operator is considered a _member_ of an OperatorGroup if the following
conditions are true:

* The Operator's CSV exists in the same namespace as the OperatorGroup.
* The Operator's CSV's InstallModes support the set of namespaces targeted by
the OperatorGroup.

An InstallMode consists of an `InstallModeType` field and a boolean `Supported`
field. A CSV's spec can contain a set of InstallModes of four distinct
`InstallModeTypes`:

.InstallModes and supported OperatorGroups
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|InstallModeType |Description

|`OwnNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects its own
 namespace.

|`SingleNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects one namespace.

|`MultiNamespace`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects more than one
namespace.

|`AllNamespaces`
|The Operator can be a member of an OperatorGroup that selects all namespaces
(target namespace set is the empty string `""`).
|===

NOTE: If a CSV's spec omits an entry of `InstallModeType`, then that type is
considered unsupported unless support can be inferred by an existing entry that
implicitly supports it.

[discrete]
==== Troubleshooting OperatorGroup membership

* If more than one OperatorGroup exists in a single namespace, any CSV created
in that namespace will transition to a failure state with the reason
`TooManyOperatorGroups`. CSVs in a failed state for this reason will
transition to pending once the number of OperatorGroups in their namespaces
reaches one.
* If a CSV's InstallModes do not support the target namespace selection of the
OperatorGroup in its namespace, the CSV will transition to a failure state
with the reason `UnsupportedOperatorGroup`. CSVs in a failed state for this
reason will transition to pending once either the OperatorGroup's target
namespace selection changes to a supported configuration, or the CSV's
InstallModes are modified to support the OperatorGroup's target namespace
selection.

[discrete]
=== Target namespace selection

Specify the set of namespaces for the OperatorGroup using a label
selector with the `spec.selector` field:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: my-group
  namespace: my-namespace
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        cool.io/prod: "true"
----

You can also explicitly name the target namespaces using the
`spec.targetNamespaces` field:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: my-group
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - my-namespace
  - my-other-namespace
  - my-other-other-namespace
----

NOTE: If both `spec.targetNamespaces` and `spec.selector` are defined,
`spec.selector` is ignored.

Alternatively, you can omit both `spec.selector` and `spec.targetNamespaces` to
specify a _global_ OperatorGroup, which selects all namespaces:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: my-group
  namespace: my-namespace
----

The resolved set of selected namespaces is shown in an OperatorGroup's
`status.namespaces` field. A global OperatorGroup's `status.namespace` contains
the empty string (`""`), which signals to a consuming Operator that it should
watch all namespaces.

[discrete]
=== OperatorGroup CSV annotations

Member CSVs of an OperatorGroup have the following annotations:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Annotation |Description

|`olm.operatorGroup=<group_name>`
|Contains the name of the OperatorGroup.

|`olm.operatorGroupNamespace=<group_namespace>`
|Contains the namespace of the OperatorGroup.

|`olm.targetNamespaces=<target_namespaces>`
|Contains a comma-delimited string that lists the OperatorGroup's target
namespace selection.
|===

NOTE: All annotations except `olm.targetNamespaces` are included with copied
CSVs. Omitting the `olm.targetNamespaces` annotation on copied CSVs prevents
the duplication of target namespaces between tenants.

[discrete]
=== Provided APIs annotation

Information about what `GroupVersionKinds` (GVKs) are provided by an
OperatorGroup are shown in an `olm.providedAPIs` annotation. The annotation's
value is a string consisting of `<kind>.<version>.<group>` delimited with
commas. The GVKs of CRDs and APIServices provided by all active member CSVs of
an OperatorGroup are included.

Review the following example of an OperatorGroup with a single active member CSV
that provides the PackageManifest resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  annotations:
    olm.providedAPIs: PackageManifest.v1alpha1.packages.apps.redhat.com
  name: olm-operators
  namespace: local
  ...
spec:
  selector: {}
  serviceAccount:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
  targetNamespaces:
  - local
status:
  lastUpdated: 2019-02-19T16:18:28Z
  namespaces:
  - local
----

[discrete]
=== Role-based access control

When an OperatorGroup is created, three ClusterRoles are generated. Each
contains a single AggregationRule with a ClusterRoleSelector set to match a
label, as shown below:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|ClusterRole |Label to match

|`<operatorgroup_name>-admin`
|`olm.opgroup.permissions/aggregate-to-admin: <operatorgroup_name>`

|`<operatorgroup_name>-edit`
|`olm.opgroup.permissions/aggregate-to-edit: <operatorgroup_name>`

|`<operatorgroup_name>-view`
|`olm.opgroup.permissions/aggregate-to-view: <operatorgroup_name>`
|===

The following RBAC resources are generated when a CSV becomes an active member of an OperatorGroup, as long as the CSV is watching all namespaces with the `AllNamespaces` InstallMode and is not in a failed state with reason `InterOperatorGroupOwnerConflict`.

* xref:olm-resources-per-api-resource-crd-{context}[ClusterRoles for each API resource from a CRD]
* xref:olm-resources-per-api-resource-api-{context}[ClusterRoles for each API resource from an APIService]
* xref:olm-resources-additional-roles-rolebindings-{context}[Additional Roles and RoleBindings]

[id='olm-resources-additional-roles-rolebindings-{context}']
.Additional Roles and RoleBindings
* If the CSV defines exactly one target namespace that contains `*`, then a
ClusterRole and corresponding ClusterRoleBinding are generated for each
permission defined in the CSV's permissions field. All resources generated are
given the `olm.owner: <csv_name>` and `olm.owner.namespace: <csv_namespace>`
labels.
* If the CSV does _not_ define exactly one target namespace that contains `*`,
then all Roles and RoleBindings in the Operator namespace with the
`olm.owner: <csv_name>` and `olm.owner.namespace: <csv_namespace>` labels are
copied into the target namespace.

[discrete]
=== Copied CSVs

OLM creates copies of all active member CSVs of an OperatorGroup in each of that
OperatorGroup's target namespaces. The purpose of a copied CSV is to tell users
of a target namespace that a specific Operator is configured to watch resources
created there. Copied CSVs have a status reason `Copied` and are updated to
match the status of their source CSV. The `olm.targetNamespaces` annotation is
stripped from copied CSVs before they are created on the cluster. Omitting the
target namespace selection avoids the duplication of target namespaces between
tenants. Copied CSVs are deleted when their source CSV no longer exists or the
OperatorGroup that their source CSV belongs to no longer targets the copied
CSV's namespace.

[discrete]
=== Static OperatorGroups

An OperatorGroup is _static_ if its `spec.staticProvidedAPIs` field is set to
`true`. As a result, OLM does not modify the OperatorGroup's `olm.providedAPIs`
annotation, which means that it can be set in advance. This is useful when a
user wants to use an OperatorGroup to prevent resource contention in a set of
namespaces but does not have active member CSVs that provide the APIs for those
resources.

Below is an example of an OperatorGroup that protects Prometheus resources in
all namespaces with the `something.cool.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"`
annotation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring
  namespace: cluster-monitoring
  annotations:
    olm.providedAPIs: Alertmanager.v1.monitoring.coreos.com,Prometheus.v1.monitoring.coreos.com,PrometheusRule.v1.monitoring.coreos.com,ServiceMonitor.v1.monitoring.coreos.com
spec:
  staticProvidedAPIs: true
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      something.cool.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
----

[discrete]
=== OperatorGroup intersection

Two OperatorGroups are said to have _intersecting provided APIs_ if the
intersection of their target namespace sets is not an empty set and the
intersection of their provided API sets, defined by `olm.providedAPIs`
annotations, is not an empty set.

A potential issue is that OperatorGroups with intersecting provided APIs can
compete for the same resources in the set of intersecting namespaces.

NOTE: When checking intersection rules, an OperatorGroup's namespace is always
included as part of its selected target namespaces.

[discrete]
==== Rules for intersection

Each time an active member CSV synchronizes, OLM queries the cluster for the set
of intersecting provided APIs between the CSV's OperatorGroup and all others.
OLM then checks if that set is an empty set:

* If `true` and the CSV's provided APIs are a subset of the OperatorGroup's:
** Continue transitioning.
* If `true` and the CSV's provided APIs are _not_ a subset of the
OperatorGroup's:
** If the OperatorGroup is static:
*** Clean up any deployments that belong to the CSV.
*** Transition the CSV to a failed state with status reason
`CannotModifyStaticOperatorGroupProvidedAPIs`.
** If the OperatorGroup is _not_ static:
*** Replace the OperatorGroup's `olm.providedAPIs` annotation with the union of
itself and the CSV's provided APIs.
* If `false` and the CSV's provided APIs are _not_ a subset of the
OperatorGroup's:
** Clean up any deployments that belong to the CSV.
** Transition the CSV to a failed state with status reason
`InterOperatorGroupOwnerConflict`.
* If `false` and the CSV's provided APIs are a subset of the OperatorGroup's:
** If the OperatorGroup is static:
*** Clean up any deployments that belong to the CSV.
*** Transition the CSV to a failed state with status reason
`CannotModifyStaticOperatorGroupProvidedAPIs`.
** If the OperatorGroup is _not_ static:
*** Replace the OperatorGroup's `olm.providedAPIs` annotation with the
difference between itself and the CSV's provided APIs.

NOTE: Failure states caused by OperatorGroups are non-terminal.

The following actions are performed each time an OperatorGroup synchronizes:

* The set of provided APIs from active member CSVs is calculated from the
cluster. Note that copied CSVs are ignored.
* The cluster set is compared to `olm.providedAPIs`, and if `olm.providedAPIs`
contains any extra APIs, then those APIs are pruned.
* All CSVs that provide the same APIs across all namespaces are requeued. This
notifies conflicting CSVs in intersecting groups that their conflict has
possibly been resolved, either through resizing or through deletion of the
conflicting CSV.
